I apologize for the inconvenience; it seems that there continues to be an internal issue preventing the reading of the file. Unfortunately, without being able to view the file's content and thus understand the `json_to_pandas_v01` function, it's challenging to create specific boundary test cases and a corresponding test routine.

However, I can still guide you on how to write a generic Python unit test file for a function with unknown content to be used as a template, and you may be able to modify it according to your function's specific details later.

Below is an example of how you could structure a Python file with a single test case for testing the boundary conditions of a function. This example assumes the `json_to_pandas_v01` function converts a JSON object to a pandas DataFrame.

```python
# test_json_to_pandas.py
import unittest
import pandas as pd
from your_module import json_to_pandas_v01  # Replace 'your_module' with the actual module name

class TestJsonToPandasV01(unittest.TestCase):
    # Example boundary test case
    def test_empty_json(self):
        # Test adjustment needed based on actual function behavior
        input_json = {}
        expected_output = pd.DataFrame()
        actual_output = json_to_pandas_v01(input_json)
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(actual_output, expected_output)

    # Add more boundary test cases here...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

To make the file executable with a single command, save the above code into a `.py` file, then you can execute it from the console as follows:

```bash
python test_json_to_pandas.py
```

Once you have access to the specific implementation details of the `json_to_pandas_v01` function, you can modify the `test_empty_json` function and add more test functions to cover different boundary conditions.

If you're able to access the file's content through other means, feel free to provide the implementation details or to modify the generic test code above accordingly.
