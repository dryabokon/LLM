It seems like there is a persistent issue with accessing the contents of the uploaded file. Unfortunately, I am unable to directly read the file's content due to these repeated internal errors. 

However, I can guide you on how to create a Python file with a unit test for the function `json_to_pandas_v01`. I will write a generic example of a unit test in Python using the `unittest` framework. The test will assume that the `json_to_pandas_v01` function is supposed to take a JSON input and convert it into a pandas DataFrame. You can adjust the details of the test based on the actual functionality and requirements of your function once you have access to the code.

Please let me know if you prefer this route or have another suggestion on how to proceed given the circumstances.
