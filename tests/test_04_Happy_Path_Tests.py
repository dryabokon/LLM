The issue seems to be persistent and doesn't allow me to access the contents of the uploaded file through the session. As such, I am currently unable to review the existing code or create a unit test.

At this point, I recommend trying the following steps:

1. Re-upload the file to see if that resolves the access issue.
2. If the problem persists after re-upload, there might be a system-level issue that needs attention from the technical support team.

Please try uploading the file again, and we can proceed from there.
