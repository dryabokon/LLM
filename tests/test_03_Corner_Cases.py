There seems to be a persistent issue accessing the file's contents. As an alternative, I can guide you on how to construct a Python test routine assuming a generic structure for `json_to_pandas_v01`. Once you have access to your environment where the original code exists, you can adapt this generic structure accordingly.

Let's assume `json_to_pandas_v01` is a function that takes a JSON object or string and converts it into a pandas DataFrame. Here's an example of how you might set up a unit test for such a function in Python using the `unittest` framework:

```python
import unittest
import pandas as pd
from your_module import json_to_pandas_v01  # Replace 'your_module' with the actual module name

class TestJsonToPandasV01(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_json(self):
        """Test the function with an empty JSON object"""
        json_input = '{}'
        expected_output = pd.DataFrame()
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(json_to_pandas_v01(json_input), expected_output)

    def test_valid_json(self):
        """Test the function with a valid JSON object"""
        json_input = '{"data": [{"id": 1, "value": "A"}, {"id": 2, "value": "B"}]}'
        expected_output = pd.DataFrame([{"id": 1, "value": "A"}, {"id": 2, "value": "B"}])
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(json_to_pandas_v01(json_input), expected_output)

    # Add more test cases for other corner cases like invalid JSON, nested JSON structures, etc.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In a console environment, assuming you save this as `test_your_module.py`, you can execute the test with the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_your_module.TestJsonToPandasV01
```

To provide you with a more accurate test routine, I would need to successfully read the file you uploaded. However, due to the repeated internal errors, this is not possible at the moment. If you have other ways to share the contents or structure of the `json_to_pandas_v01` function, I would be able to assist you further.
