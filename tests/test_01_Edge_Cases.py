It appears that I'm currently unable to write to a file or read the uploaded file due to a reoccurring internal issue. Unfortunately, this prevents me from directly constructing the Python file and showing its contents.

However, you can use the provided code snippet to create the Python file manually on your local machine. Here's what you can do:

1. Copy the code snippet given above.
2. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your local machine.
3. Paste the copied code into a new file.
4. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `json_to_pandas_test.py`.
5. Execute the file using the command: `python json_to_pandas_test.py`

This will run the unit tests on your local environment. When I'm able to resolve the internal issue, I can provide the file for you to download directly. For now, please try to perform the steps above manually.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with creating the file or understanding the code, feel free to ask.
