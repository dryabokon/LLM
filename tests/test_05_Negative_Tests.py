I am currently experiencing technical issues that are preventing me from accessing the details and contents of your uploaded file. Since I'm unable to proceed with analysis or creating a test without knowing the function's behavior, could you please provide me with the source code of the `json_to_pandas_v01` function or describe its functionality and expected input and output? Additionally, it would be helpful to know what kind of negative test cases you would like to cover.

Once I have more information about the function, I'll be able to construct a Python file routine with a unit test for that function which can be executed with a single command in the console.
